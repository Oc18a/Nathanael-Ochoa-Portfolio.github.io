My name is Nathanael Ochoa and this is my project portfolio. 
The MS Data Science folder contains 3 completed projects from the Data Science Master's program that I am currently in.
It currently contains a python program that incorporates 2 API calls that allow users to search up the current weather in a city of their choosing, a data analysis using the R language, and a data analysis using Jupyter Notebook. 
More projects will be added as I complete them in the program!
The OpenClassrooms folder contains a SQL data analysis project from their "Database Querying with SQL" certification program.
