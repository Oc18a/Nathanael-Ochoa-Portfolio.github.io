Term Project
A Jupyter Notebook file containing your statistical question/hypothesis
*  Minimum of 5 variables in your dataset used during your analysis. Consider what you think could have an impact on your question - remember this is never perfect, so don’t be worried if you miss one.
* Describe what the 5 variables mean in the dataset.
* Include a histogram of each of the 5 variables - in your summary and analysis, identify any outliers and explain the reasoning for them being outliers and how you believe they should be handled.
* Include the other descriptive characteristics about the variables: mean, mode. Spread, and tails.
* Compare 2 scenarios in your data using a PMF. Reminder, this isn’t comparing 2 variables against each other -  it is the same variable, but a different scenario. Almost like a filter. The example in the book is first babies compared to all other babies, it is still the same variable, but breaking the data out based on criteria we are exploring.
* Create 1 CDF with one of your variables, what does this tell you about your variable and how does it address the question you are trying to answer.
* Plot 1 analytical distribution and provide your analysis on how it applies to the dataset you have chosen.
* Create 2 scatter plots comparing 2 variables and provide your analysis on correlation and causation. Remember, covariance, Pearson’s correlation, and non-linear relationships should also be considered during your analysis.
* Conduct a test on your hypothesis using one of the methods covered in chapter 9 (i.e. classical hypothesis testing, testing a difference in means, testing a correlation, etc.).
* For this project, conduct a regression analysis on either one dependent and one explanatory variable, or multiple explanatory variables.
* A 250-500 summary of the following:
* Statistical/hypothetical question
* Outcome of your EDA
* What do you feel was missed during the analysis?
* Were there any variables you felt could have helped in the analysis?
* Were there any assumptions made you felt were incorrect?
* What challenges did you face, what did you not fully understand?
