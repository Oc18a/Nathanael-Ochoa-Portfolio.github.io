Final Project Step 1
You will be working on a research paper for your final project. This project will include identifying a topic/problem that you want to solve using data science. While the final solution to the problem does not need to be provided via programming - you will be doing some exploratory data analysis, transformations, and summary statistics on the data via R. You are welcome to create a model based on what you have learned in this course to solve the problem, but this is not required. Instead, a recommendation is required for a model or method you would implement to solve the problem. There are 3 steps to this project, with the final deliverable being a formal paper (completed in R Markdown) that outlines the problem, shows the analysis done with the data, and concludes with your recommendation for next steps. Each step provides detailed information that you must include in each phase of the project.
* Identify a topic or problem that you want to research. Provide an introduction that explains the problem statement or topic you are addressing. Why would someone be interested in this? How is it a data science problem?
* Draft 5-10 research questions that focus on the problem statement/topic.
* Provide a concise explanation of how you plan to address this problem statement.
* Discuss how your proposed approach will address (fully or partially) this problem.
* Do some digging and find at least 3 datasets that you can use to address the issue. (There is not a required number of fields or rows for these datasets)
* Original source where the data was obtained is cited, and if possible, hyperlinked.
* Source data is thoroughly explained (i.e. what was the original purpose of the data, when it was collected, how many variables did the original have, explain any peculiarities of the source data such as how missing values are recorded, or how data was imputed, etc.).
* Identify the packages that are needed for your project.
* What types of plots and tables will help you to illustrate the findings to your research questions?
* What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to answer your research questions?



Final Project Step 2
At this point you should have framed your problem/topic, described the data, and how you plan to solve the problem. Now you need to move on to the next step of analyzing and preparing the data. Adding on to the draft you started in Step 1:
* Data importing and cleaning steps are explained in the text and follow a logical process. Outline your data preparation and cleansing steps.
* With a clean dataset, show what the final dataset looks like. However, do not print off a data frame with 200+ rows; show me the data in the most condensed form possible.
* What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to import and clean up your dataset?
* Discuss how you plan to uncover new information in the data that is not self-evident.
* What are different ways you could look at this data to answer the questions you want to answer?
* Do you plan to slice and dice the data in different ways, create new variables, or join separate data frames to create new summary information? Explain.
* How could you summarize your data to answer key questions?
* What types of plots and tables will help you illustrate the findings to your questions? Ensure that all graph plots have axis titles, legend if necessary, scales are appropriate, appropriate geoms used, etc.).
* What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to answer your questions?
* Do you plan on incorporating any machine learning techniques to answer your research questions? Explain.



Final Project Step 3
You are now on to the final phase of your research paper. While this step does not require you to build a model, you are welcome to do so if you feel you have the time. Instead, you need to make a recommendation for the approach you would take and what the remaining steps would be using the information you have learned in this course to take this project from simply being an analysis exercise to proposed implementation of a solution.
* Overall, write a coherent narrative that tells a story with the data as you complete this section.
* Summarize the problem statement you addressed.
* Summarize how you addressed this problem statement (the data used and the methodology employed, including a recommendation for a model that could be implemented).
* Summarize the interesting insights that your analysis provided.
* Summarize the implications to the consumer (target audience) of your analysis.
* Discuss the limitations of your analysis and how you, or someone else, could improve or build on it.
